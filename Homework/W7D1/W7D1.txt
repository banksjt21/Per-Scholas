W7D1 - JavaScript Callbacks and Arrow Functions
===============================================


❓ When the add and subtract functions are passed as arguments to the compute function - they are ___ functions.
- Callbacks


❓ In your own words describe what the term "implicit return" means.
-  An implicit return occurs when an arrow function returns data without using the 'return' keyword.
-  It occurs when the expression following the arrow (=>) is 'concise' (single-statement).
-  If multiple expressions or lines of code are needed in the body of the function, then it will not be implicit.
-  The body of the function will also need to be enclosed in braces.


❓ Describe what a callback function is in your own words.
-  A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function.
-  A callback function can be used within an asynchronous function to make a block of code run when the asynchronous function finishes executing.
